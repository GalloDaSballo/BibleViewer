## Had some trouble with sqlite package

Working through [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxiQDo0CmDE&feature=youtu.be&t=932) which uses sqlite [3.0.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite/v/3.0.3), very different than current version sqlite [4.0.12](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite#opening-the-database).

My attempts to get 4.0.12 working are in the `data/db-config.js` folder. None of them ran correctly.

* Should I have spent the time getting it to work with new code?
* OR just worked with old package 3.0.3 packages?
* With this most recent change I couldnâ€™t find any tutorials, so unsure what to do in that case
